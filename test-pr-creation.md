# PR Creation Workflow Test

This file was created to test the pull request creation workflow as part of issue #16.

## Purpose

This is a test file to validate that:
- Branch creation works correctly
- File modifications can be made
- Commits can be created
- Pull requests can be created from the agent system

This file can be safely removed after the PR workflow has been validated.
